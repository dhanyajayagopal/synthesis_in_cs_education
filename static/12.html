      <h2>Introduction to Binary Trees</h2>

      <p>
        A
        <b class="def">binary tree</b>
        is a data structure made up of
        <b class="def">nodes</b>,
        each of which has a data value associated with it.
        Each node has exactly two child subtrees: a
        <b class="def">left child</b>
        and a
        <b class="def">right child</b>,
        either (or both) of which may be empty.
        We refer to the top-most node of a binary tree as its
        <b class="def">root</b>.
        For example, this diagram depicts a binary tree:
      </p>

      <div>
        <canvas class="tree-bg">
        </canvas>

        <div class="tree" id="example-1a">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the example above, the node containing 1 is the root. It has two
        children: the node containing 2 and the node containing 3. The left
        child of the node containing 4 is the node containing 8, and the right
        child of the node containing 4 is empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, for convenience, we draw binary trees without explicitly
        depicting empty children. The example above can thus also be drawn as
        follows:
      </p>

      <div>
        <canvas class="tree-bg">
        </canvas>

        <div class="tree" id="example-1b">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We can implement a binary tree in Python as follows:
      </p>

      <div class="center-code">
        <div>
          <code>class Node:
    def __init__(self, v):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = v</code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        To construct the binary tree drawn above, we could then use the
        following code:
      </p>

      <div class="center-code">
        <div>
          <code>node1 = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node3 = Node(3)
node4 = Node(4)
node5 = Node(5)
node6 = Node(6)
node7 = Node(7)
node8 = Node(8)

node4.left = node8
node2.left = node4
node2.right = node5

node3.left = node6
node3.right = node7

node1.left = node2
node1.right = node3</code>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Introduction to Binary Search Trees (BSTs)</h2>

      <p>
        A
        <b class="def">binary <i>search</i> tree (BST)</b>
        is a binary tree with three invariants:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>All values in the tree are unique.</li>
        <li>Each node value is <b>greater</b> than all values in its <b>left</b> child.</li>
        <li>Each node value is <b>less</b> than all values in its <b>right</b> child.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For example, here is a binary search tree:
      </p>

      <div>
        <canvas class="tree-bg">
        </canvas>

        <div class="tree" id="example-2">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you look at, for example, the node containing 3, you will see that
        all values to its left are less than 3 (1 and 2) and all values to its
        right are greater than 3 (4, 6, and 7). This pattern must be true of all
        nodes in a binary search tree.
      </p>

      <h2>Why are binary search trees important?</h2>

      <p>
        Binary search trees are important because there are efficient algorithms
        that support the following operations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Determining whether a value is in a BST.</li>
        <li>Inserting a value into a BST.</li>
        <li>Removing a value from a BST.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Task 1: Searching in a BST</h2>

      <p>
        Using the BST invariants, we can efficiently traverse a BST to search
        it for a particular value.
